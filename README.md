## Information
This function implements a typical swap function for an array. This is not easily accessible in Ruby (to my knowledge) so I made a function for me but am happy to share it with you!
This function is built with Ruby v2.6.5p114. To check your version, run:
```
ruby -v
```
## Status
At this time, the project is __*finished*__.
## Instructions
To run these program, Ruby v2.6.3p62 (or a compatible version) will need to be installed. To check the version of ruby you are using, run this command in terminal:
```
ruby -v
```
If you do not have ruby installed, follow these [instructions](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).
After ruby is installed, you should clone this repository to a place easily accessible to you using this command in terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/fussykyloren/ruby-array-swap.git
```
Your github username and password should be requested. If not, don't worry about it.
After the repository is cloned, you will need to change the directory to where the game example is saved. To to use the fibonacci programs, run this command next:
```
cd [LOCATION_OF_CLONED_REPOSITORY]
```
Now you can move the ruby file to where you will need to use it! This can be done using this command:
```
mv [LOCATION_OF_CLONED_REPOSITORY]/swap.rb [LOCATION_TO_MOVE_FILE]
```
Or if you'd prefer, you can copy the file using this command:
```
cp [LOCATION_OF_CLONED_REPOSITORY]/swap.rb [LOCATION_TO_MOVE_FILE]
```
