## Information
This function implements a typical swap function for an array. This is not easily accessible in Ruby (to my knowledge) so I made a function for me but am happy to share it with you!
This function is built with Ruby v2.6.5p114. To check your version, run:
```
ruby -v
```
## Status
At this time, the project is __*finished*__.
## Instructions
1. If you do not have ruby installed, follow these [instructions](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).
2. Clone this repository using the following link: https://github.com/fussykyloren/ruby-array-swap.git
3. Use the function as you wish! If you have any suggestions, don't hesitate to raise an issue!
