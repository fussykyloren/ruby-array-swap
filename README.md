# Ruby - Function to Swap Array Elements
## Table of Contents
## Information
This function implements a typical swap function for an array. This is not easily accessible in Ruby (to my knowledge) so I made a function for me but am happy to share it with you!
This function is built with Ruby v2.6.5p114. To check your version, run:
```
ruby -v
```
## Status
At this time, the project is __*finished*__.
